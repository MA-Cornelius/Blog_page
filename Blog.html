            <p>Now, if you did all these things at once, it would be hard to
            predict what might happen to the cake's flavor. It might be
            moister, but it might also taste bad; it might be so moist it
            doesn't finish baking; it might be too moist and soggy; or it
            might be just what you're looking for. However, if you're a professional chef, you couldn't afford to waste the time (and ingredients) on such a hit-or-miss approach to improving the recipe. You'd want to do it systematically, so that you could tell
            what thing you did made the cake taste better.</p>

            <p>A student reads the correct horoscope from the right day to a
            group of people and asks them if they think it applies to them.Later, the student reads the wrong horoscope from the wrong day to different group of people and asks them the same question. The student i trying to find out if people can tell the difference between the right and wrong horoscopes, and infer from that whether or not as actually works.</p>

          <p>This experiment would be a good case for using the "doubleblind" design, where the experimenter doesn't know if they are reading the right horoscope or not. To improve the design,the experimenter would have to have a 3rd person, probablyan assistant, scramble the horoscopes so that the experimenter wouldn't know whether or not the correct horoscopewas being read to the subject. In that way the experimenter's prejudices wouldn't interfere. When the results are done, the assistant unscrambles the results and sorts them according to the independent variable.</p>
